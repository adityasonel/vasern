## What is Vasern?

Vasern is a data storage for React Native that underneath is linked-consistent key-value stores. Its data engine is built natively to achieve native performance. Our goal is to develop an open source, developer friendly end-to-end database solution. Sync server - [vasern-server](https://github.com/vasern/vasern-server) is under development.

#### A snipped code shows how Vasern works

```javascript
import Vasern from 'vasern';

// Define Todos application schema
const VasernDB = new Vasern({ 
  schemas: [{
    name: "Users",
    props: {
      fname: "string",
      lname: "string"
    }
  },{
    name: "Todos",
    props: {
      name: "string",
      completed: "boolean",
      assignTo: "#Users"
    }
  }]
});

// Add listener whenever Todos has a change (loaded/insert/update/delete)
VasernDB.Todos.onChange(() => {

  // Get all todo items with "completed" is "false"
  const todoList = VasernDB.Todos.filter({ completed: false });
  
  // Update state
  this.setState({ data: todoList.data() });
})
```

## Development Status

Vasern beta is **available on iOS and Android**. It is being heavily tested to ensure its functionality, data quality and consistency. View [Development Roadmap](roadmap.md)

Most of APIs wonâ€™t be changed in the near future. A stable release of Vasern will be announced within a month from now unless there are major issues. After the stable release, Vasern will continue to be maintained and improved.
